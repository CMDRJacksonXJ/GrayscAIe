# GrayscAIe
An AI (sorta) for recognizing 4x4 grayscale images.
This not-really-AI can recognize 4x4 grayscale images across five different shapes. 
For it to work, open up MSPaint, paint.net, whatever and make a 4x4 grayscale image, and make sure the filename is "input.png".
Also, put the image in the same place as you ran the python script.
This should work on any Python version from 3.8 onwards.

v1.0: Released (f03.04.05).
